# AIVA: Advanced Intelligent Virtual Assistant

## Project Overview
AIVA (Advanced Intelligent Virtual Assistant) is a desktop-based personal assistant designed to provide intelligent assistance. It integrates voice recognition, biometric authentication, and AI-driven automation to enhance user experience. The project utilizes Python for backend processing and JavaFX for the desktop GUI. The database system consists of MongoDB for data storage.

## Features
- **Voice Command Processing**: Accepts and processes voice commands for various tasks.
- **AI/ML Integration**: Leverages machine learning for advanced interactions and personalized responses.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Uses facial recognition and fingerprint authentication for security.
- **Desktop Application**: Built using JavaFX.
- **Database Management**:
  - **MongoDB**: Stores unstructured and structured data like chat logs, voice recordings, and user information.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enhances command recognition and response accuracy.

## Tech Stack
